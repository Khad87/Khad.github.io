**Welcome to my portfolio!**
My first name is Khadija, but everyone calls me Khad.
I am a seasoned technical writer and documentation lead with over 13 years of experience in the high tech industry. I have created content for a variety of customer audiences. I can create highly technical content or simplified end user content depending on the needs of my target audience.
As a documentation lead, I managed various projects and led teams of writers. Due to my agile approach to project management, I can pivot to accomodate unexpected changes. i have also managed the documentation for continuous delivery programs, so I can work under pressure and meet tight deadlines.
