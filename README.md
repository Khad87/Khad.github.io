**Welcome to my portfolio!**

My first name is Khadija, but everyone calls me Khad.
I am a seasoned technical writer and documentation lead with over 13 years of experience in the high tech industry. I have created content for a variety of customer audiences. I can create highly technical content or simplified end user content depending on the needs of my target audience.
As a documentation lead, I managed various projects and led teams of writers. I have an adaptable, agile approach to project management and I can pivot to accomodate unexpected changes. I work well under pressure and can meet tight deadlines. I thrive in a fast-paced environment.
