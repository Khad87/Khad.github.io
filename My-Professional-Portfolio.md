# Overview of my skillset
I can create content for a variety of audiences. I have created instructional manuals, quick start guides, articles, Release Notes, and more. When developing content, I analyze the target audience. I can write highly technical content or simplified end user content depending on the needs of the target audience. As a writer, my priority is to ensure that my target audience can easily access the information they need without being overwhelmed by irrelevant information.

I take the initiative to test products, learn about new features, and find the information I need. I make sure I thoroughly understand the content before documenting it. 

As a documentation lead, I managed various projects, including continuous delivery projects where I published documentation every two weeks. I worked on projects independently and I also led teams of writers. My approach to project management is agile, and I can handle unexpected changes and tight deadlines. I thrive in a fast-paced environment.

# Work samples

## Article
Attached is a PDF version of a short article I created for a cloud program. Articles provide bite-sized chunks of information about a specific user goal or task. According to the Pareto principle, 80% of users need 20% of the documentation content. With articles, users can quickly get the key information they need to get their job done without searching through extensive documentation. Typically, articles are published in a web-based format. This article was created for a program that is being discontinued, so its content is no longer available online.

## Revised technical content
My most recent Avaya project was a legacy program that returned to the forefront. The documentation was in a state of disrepair and was full of outdated content. Attached is an example of a document where I made significant changes. I tested all the content and rewrote a lot of it. The revised document is attached.
